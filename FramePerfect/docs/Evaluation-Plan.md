# Evaluation Plan (Tradeshow & Final Round)

## Goals
- Validate value of **Playlists-as-Lessons**
- Validate clarity/joy of **Combo Maker** (+ export & sharing)
- Validate **site ↔ overlay** workflow for mentors

## Core Tasks
1) Learner: “Find Devil Jin’s df+2, add it to a new playlist, share the link.”
2) Mentor: “Open the overlay, load that playlist, guide a learner through first 3 steps.”
3) Both: “Create a small combo in Combo Maker and export a PNG. Post it to the mock Discord.”

## Measures
- Task success/time
- Think-aloud emotional cues (confidence/frustration)
- Short exit interview (3 prompts)

## Observation Notes
- Where do users hesitate?
- What do they try to click that doesn’t exist?
- What do they want to keep afterwards (artifacts)?
